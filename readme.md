#  HI if you wanna practice how to create a pull request then follow these steps:- 

-Fork this repository to your own github profile 
  (Which will make a copy of this repository in your git account
  which is linked to my repository where you fork it from.)
    - There is a fork button in the top-right corner of the repo
    // So now the repo in my account is original repo
    // And the copied repo in your account is a forked repo

-Then clone the forked repository into your computer
    - To clone it you have to copy the link of your forked repo 
        - Click on the arrow next to the green code button in your repo
        - And copy the link from there
    - Go to your pc make open git bash or anything similar and use this command
    - git clone <copied_link_here>

-Then create a branch aside from the default master branch using
    - git branch <new_branch_name>
    - git checkout <new_branch_name>
    // The <git checkout> command is used so you can switch to that branch
    // And all the change and commits will be made in this branch
    // WE should alwaws create new branch for new feature, bug fix and any changes.
-Then write some lines at the end of this(readme.txt) file.
-Add and Commit those changes.
-Then push these to your remote repo as how you usually do.
//Remember to push your <new_branch> the one your created not the master branch
-Then go to your repo and you can see a new option <Comare & Pull Request>
-Then the rest should be easy
